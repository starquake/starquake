## Hi! It's me, Jan!

Retro gaming enjoyer • Go/PHP Developer • Linux enthusiast

### I'm looking for a new job opportunity as a Go/PHP Developer!

I worked professionally with PHP and Symfony from 2001 to 2012, building web applications. From 2012 to 2017, I worked 
with .NET on web applications, then transitioned to microservices from 2017 to 2023. In 2023, I returned to PHP and 
started working with Go. 

I'm currently building a self-hosted quiz app in Go and learning Laravel.

Have an interesting opportunity? Email me! The address is on my GitHub profile.
